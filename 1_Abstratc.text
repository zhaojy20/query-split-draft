Re-optimization is proposed to solve the cardinality estimation problem by correcting estimation errors during run-time. Re-optimization detects the estimation error by materializing the sub-plan, a sub-tree of the global plan tree. However, this behavior may cause the sub-plan to inherit the sub-optimal join order of the global plan. In this paper, we propose a new perspective of re-optimization called the sub-query perspective, which discards the concept of the global plan and, thus, avoids the misleading global plan. Furthermore, we designed a new re-optimization framework called \textit{query split}, which takes advantage of the sub-query perspective. By integrating \textit{query split} into PostgreSQL, we have a considerable speedup for total end-to-end latency on Join Order Benchmark and achieve near-optimal latency by comparing with the optimal execution plan. Our finding reveals that entirely discarding the global plan in re-optimization can benefit the query processing and significantly reduce end-to-end latency.
