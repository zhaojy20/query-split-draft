    Re-optimization can help the database optimizer avoid the intrinsic difficulty of cardinality estimation. But current re-optimization still needs the global plan to start the initial query execution, which can cause a sub-optimal execution procedure before re-optimization is triggered. In this paper, we propose \textit{query split}, a re-optimization framework with the new sub-query perspective. Discarding the global plan and proactively interleaving query optimization and execution, \textit{query split} reaches near-optimal latency in Join Order Benchmark. Our results suggest that the sub-query perspective can avoid misleading global plans and improve query execution speed. Furthermore, the case study shows that the latency of most queries is dominated by one physical operator. The result implies that the execution time on the query can be hugely improved by improving the bottleneck operator itself. There is little room for further improvement under the re-optimization framework.
